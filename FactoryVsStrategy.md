# 🤔 Factory vs. Strategy — What's the Difference?

### Factory Pattern is about creating objects — it decides which object to instantiate based on input.

### Strategy Pattern is about choosing behavior — it decides how an object should behave at runtime.

🏭 Factory = “What to build”   |  🧠 Strategy = “How to behave”
